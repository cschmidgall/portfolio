            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I&apos;m Christopher Schmidgall.<br>
                I&apos;ve been fascinated with how software works since the days of uninstalling and 
                reinstalling X-Wing vs TIE Fighter, on my dads computer, from floppy disks just 
                from the joy of learning how it worked. That early curiosity grew into a career focused 
                on learning how to build things, from signs, houses, garages and buildings to eventually 
                computers and software.<br>
                I began in Computer Aided Design, where I learned how to translate user needs into clear, 
                functional drawings to be reviewed and approved by city officials. Over time, with new 
                technologies used in drafting and construction project coordination, that foundation 
                helped me to develve deeper into programming, systems thinking, and full-stack 
                development.<br>
                For six years, I developed and maintained a enterprise-scale financial web application, 
                contributing across frontend and backend technologies, collaborating with distributed 
                teams from all over the United States and India, and adapting quickly as our workflows 
                evolved through Agile methodologies and AI-assisted tools.<br>
                Today, I&apos;m continuing to grow, exploring cloud technologies, data engineering, Power BI, 
                and modern AI development techniques. I enjoy solving problems, learning deeply, and 
                creating systems that make a meaningful impact.
